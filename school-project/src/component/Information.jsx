            We share our campus with a private college that offers NCV programmes from Level 2 to Level 4.

        <p>You get the excellent Curro education
          We are committed to providing learners with a quality education. That is why our approach to teaching the national CAPS curriculum is based on project-based learning and self-discovery. This approach allows our high school learners to explore the learning material beyond just the textbook through research, experiments and assignments, while preparing for the IEB exams in Grade 12. Teaching takes place in English, and our specialised elective subjects even include Drama and Visual Arts.
          Curroâ€™s dedication to a quality education extends to the private college on our campus. NCV programmes provide students with workplace-ready skills and knowledge, which means that your child can immediately employable if they choose not to study further. Furthermore, class sizes are limited so that lecturers can pay personal attention to each student.</p>
